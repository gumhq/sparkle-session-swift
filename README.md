# sparkle-session-swift

Session Keys are ephemeral keys with fine grained program/instruction scoping for tiered access in your Solana Programs. Session Keys enables application developers to build smooth and seemless user experience by getting rid of the wallet popups.

This swift package is primarily an IDL wrapper around [Gum's Session Key Program](https://github.com/gumhq/gpl/tree/master/programs/gpl_session).
